# Stock_Price_Movement_Prediction
### Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using machine learning and time-series forecasting techniques. The goal is to analyze historical stock data and make future predictions based on trends.

#### Project Overview
Loads and cleans stock market data
Performs exploratory data analysis
Uses LSTM / regression models (depending on your notebook)
Trains on historical closing prices
Predicts next-day or future stock values

#### Features
Data preprocessing & visualization
Time-series modeling
LSTM-based deep learning model (if used)
Comparison of predicted vs actual stock prices
Graphs for trends & forecast performance

#### Technologies Used
Python
Panda
NumPy
TensorFlow / Keras
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

#### How to Run
Download or clone the repository
Install required dependencies
Open and run the notebook
View prediction graphs

#### Dataset
Uses publicly available stock data (Yahoo Finance / CSV). Replace with the exact data source you used.

#### Results
Model predicts stock movement with reasonable accuracy
Loss curves and prediction graphs included
Good demonstration of ML for financial forecasting

#### License
Open for learning and experimentation.
